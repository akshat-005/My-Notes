# My Notes

### Using GitHub for my Personal Note-taking

This is my first GitHub commit. 
-I am learning how to make a commit on GitHub and use it as my personal notetaking software. 
-It also has a feature to add links and reirect you to different pages. For creating the clickable link we enclode within "[]" and then the "{}" contain the actual link.
-Another cool feature is that you can make a table or chart format sort of using pipeline. "|"
